# Crafting Table
A mod for Vintage Story https://mods.vintagestory.at/craftingtable

## Needed?
The game already offers a crafting grid with the player. Why make a table that does the same thing?

Learning. The primary reason I made this mod was to learn how the GUI works in the game. It took hours to figure it all out as documentation is nearly non-existant. It still isn't *perfect*, but it's more than functional.

## Uses?
Quite a lot of users have expressed their thanks in this mod as it makes crafting large or complex lines easier because the table **KEEPS** the items placed on the grid and even shows small versions on top of the table.

## Code
The code is all here to hopefully help others trying to tackle the same issues. Bug fixes or new features can be submitted via pull request.
